## Problem statement
In Java, implement a simple ceiling fan which has two pull cords and the following characteristics:
· One cord increases the speed each time it is pulled. There are 3 speed settings, and an “off” (speed 0) setting. If the cord is pulled on speed 3, the fan returns to the “off” setting.
· One cord reverses the direction of the fan at the current speed setting. Once the direction has been reversed, it remains reversed as we cycle through the speed settings, until reversed again.
· The ceiling fan should be “off” on December 25th all day even if the cords are pulled.
· You can assume the unit is always powered (no wall switch)

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
